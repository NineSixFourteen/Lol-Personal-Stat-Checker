# Admin Page 

The purpose of the admin page is to give access to all of the api to controll the database and to test its responses. It is broken into 4 main parts which I have called panels. 

1. [Status Panel](./Status.md) 
2. [Add Panel](./Add.md)
3. [Delete Panel](./Delete.md) 
4. [Get Panel](./Get.md)
